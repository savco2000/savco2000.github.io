The first person to suggest that I write a blog was my first supervisor at my first ever job as a student assistant at the IT department of The State University of New York (SUNY) at Buffalo back around the year 2004. He was a youthful stocky man who was originally from South Korea and had spent his childhood in Argentina before moving to the US.

He had taken me for lunch one day and we were discussing some current affairs most probably the then ongoing [Iraq War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iraq_War).  Apparently, he was intrigued by my insights and all of a sudden he looked straight into my eyes with a sly smile and asked me "Why don't you start a blog?" 

I thought he was pulling my leg as I thought that my analysis was pretty obvious to everyone. Plus if Jay-Z doesn't write down his lyrics, why should I write down my ideas? Afterall, just like Jay-Z I could always summon them on demand.

Fast forward almost two decades later and I can no longer summon my ideas as readily as Jay-Z can summon his lyrics. I have also heard this chorus of "You should write a blog/do a podcast!" from many friends, workmates, acquaintances and family including my mother that I have finally caved in and agreed to write a blog. Wish me luck!

This blog will consist of topics that I find interesting including music, business, science and technology, governance, human psychology, human organizations and societies.

I have deliberately chosen not to allow for comments in the blog posts because I don't have the time, energy and patience to perform content moderation. However, please feel free to email me if you need to get in touch.
