## Welcome to my Blog

The first person to suggest that I write a blog was my first supervisor at my first ever job as a student assistant at the IT department of The State University of New York (SUNY) at Buffalo back around the year 2004. 

He had taken me for lunch one day and we were discussing some current affairs. Apparently, he was intrigued by my insights and all of a sudden he looked straight into my eyes with a sly smile and asked me "Why don't you start a blog?" 

I thought he was pulling my leg as I thought that my analysis was pretty obvious to everyone. Plus if Jay-Z doesn't write down his lyrics, why should I write down my ideas? Afterall all, just like Jay-Z I could always recall them whenever I needed to.

Fast forward almost two decades later and my memory isn't as great as Jay-Z's anymore. I have also heard this chorus of "You should write a blog/do a podcast!" from my friends and even my mother. So I have finally caved in and agreed to write a blog. Wish me luck!

This blog will consist of topics that I find interesting including business, science and technology, governance, human psychology and human societies.

I have deliberately chosen not to allow for comments in the blog posts because I don't have the time and energy to perform content moderation. However, please feel free to email me if you need to get in touch.
