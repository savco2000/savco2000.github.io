I am a creative, imaginative and inquisitive systems thinker and people person who is interested in fully exploring the human condition and it influences the physical world.

I was born in Nakuru, Kenya on November 12, 1981. My family moved to Kenya's capital city Nairobi when I was about 5 years old. We lived in Nairobi until 1999 when my family moved to Harare, Zimbabwe. Zimbabwe left a lasting impression on me as it was the first foreign country that I visited.

In August 2002, I moved to Buffalo, NY, USA to begin my undergraduate studies in Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering at The State University of New York (SUNY) at Buffalo. Less than a month after my arrival in the US 9/11 happened! This forever changed the character of the US which prior to then had been largely insulated from the world.

I completed my undergraduate studies in May 2007 and proceeded to enroll in the Masters in Mechanical Engineering program at The State University of New York (SUNY) at Buffalo where I graduated in February 2009 at the height of the 2008 recession. Perfect timing!

As a result, I couldn't find a mechanical engineering job and had to move from Buffalo, NY to Washington DC where I found an entry-level job as a software developer as I had always programmed computers since my late teens as a hobby. 

I have been in tech ever since!

Contrary to what I would have initially thought, the tech industry has taught me a lot about people and organizations. It has provided me with insights into the business world and I believe it has prepared me adequately for the next chapter in my life, whatever that may be!
